 Sudekis was so happy he didn't have to pronounce a weird name. #oscars Zac Efron will be haunted by that reading fumble forever #oscars http://t.co/irjNyMt41J "Gravity sucked" my 5yr old daughter who did not see Gravity. #truedetectiveseason2 http://t.co/LBCwwfJY1b "All the ladies want to marry him for sure. I heard one lady yell 'oh sexy man!" my 5 yr old daughter when Channing Tatum came out #Oscars I mean, it wasn't that hard to make Jared Leto look like a woman. #Oscars @SarahThyre I'm legitimately upset. @white_lightning It's the best. @SarahThyre We were supposed to be childless and together tonight. Where did we go wrong?? Watching his red carpet interview I felt like Jared Leto *may* have been high on cocaine, now we know... #oscars http://t.co/agksv6YsFI Angelina's new boobs are fucking amazing. #oscars "If I don't fall 3 times tonight, no one will know I'm real." Jennifer Lawrence, probably I believe Jared Leto has the perfect ombre just to taunt women. #oscars @Sethrogen @BuzzFeed unless he went blind, yes. @Sethrogen @BuzzFeed frankly, the girl being brunette is more startling. @darthCinephile @amyanderberg it is @nicholebeattie üí©üí® 4 ever @johnlevenstein there was hail here on Friday night (it looked like diamonds.) It's within the realm of possibility. http://t.co/7D6uH1UbNk @RealSdotbailey I do, right behind the theater there are hills :) I live a few blocks from the Kodak Theatre and it just started raining again. I hope it gets worse. I want to see panic. This photo of @jimmykimmel and @TOMayorFord is perfect. http://t.co/TGxYT82Ytl @MorleyNirenberg @etalkCTV you guys are down the hill from my house. Save me fries. @ScherryyR freaks and geeks @ChrisMatyszczyk @bendreyfuss pyrogy are eastern euro.. It's flour and potato and onion... Ukrainian, Polish, German etc @bendreyfuss good. I'm glad Ukraine has no exports. Pyrogy. @bendreyfuss why obvious? Congratulations to @jimmykimmel for bringing @TOMayorFord to LA for the Oscars. All of my dreams are coming true. I hate myself for thinking it's sweet that Jackie and Kelso are engaged. :( http://t.co/u8ifMGog0i It's 9am and raining. I'm drinking coffee and watching Splash with my 5 yr old. She loves John Candy. This is as good as it gets. Just discovered I live in a world where someone named Da Brat is a millionaire. @PhizLair Exactly. xxoo @PhizLair "go west" while Keener stalks Corrigan. It's perfect. @AndyRichter I buy 'boyfriend' cut jeans for babies. When I was 9yrs old I would massage my cheeks because I read some YA fiction that said it would give me better cheekbones, so yeah, hate me. @PhizLair I love this scene with you. http://t.co/TEIp918LXk @iamledgin I love Instagram. :/ @molls yes. legit. for real. @RumBraker @Sethrogen sorry, I used to live in Victoria and I've worked with Alzheimer's patients. Proud of you and Lauren, Seth! this photo sums everything up, forever. http://t.co/diVOeHh1Hr @mpullinger I only wish you'd done it 5 mins earlier while I was with my EPs!! Xo @hotpatooties uber for coffee. @rachelantonoff !!! I love it !!! Next to waking yourself up laughing, it's the very best. When someone in my dream makes a joke &amp; people laugh, I'm always lucid enough to think, "I came up with it, a-hole." So @pretareporter amazingly made me look like a lady... and it worked for an hour.  http://t.co/UzR7gtvzXt @hotpatooties I didn't even let you shower. #bestie @nohollabackgrrl DEAD!!!!!!!! I hope Vince Gilligan is a fan of True Detective because now it's his turn to know how this feels. @caseyrosewilson GET IT (no idea what that means/seems appropriate) Nothing irritates me more online than a stranger on twitter who sends me insults, then calls me a bully when I reply. Only a crazy person wants to be the most interesting person in the room. @doniveson Cool, now I'm going to get "Even the Mayor thinks you should come back!" texts from my mom every hour for the next year. @ikebarinholtz probably. Maybe I should write a book. @ikebarinholtz I didn't childproof. Ever. @AliAdler thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è @andylassner it was the very best place to live for hockey in the 80's. Don't leave! I'm basically an NHL talisman!!!! This may be the only time I can tweet this and not feel weird: I Am From Edmonton. Hey USA, did you see the Canadian president this morning? What a goof. http://t.co/57VKynV2JC @markhoppus thank you! Big games for us! Took gold is both men's and women's sports that are our heart! Xxoo The only people up and tweeting in my feed are Canadians. We are the most polite, doing this while the US sleeps. All of the Canadian hockey players are so cute, it's hilarious. GOLD! Going back to sleep...
