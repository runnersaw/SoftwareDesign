 @steveagee I was wondering if David O Russell knew about this before casting... If not, the universe is genius. @pattonoswalt you were nothing short of fucking spectacular. @billyeichner watching you &amp; Elena
James "The teasing of this woman!" 
Bea earnestly, "Dad? that's. this. show." @MTF At the very end, when he's laughing and tosses out "@JulietteLewis " makes me think he didn't know! @mattejacob What are you talking about? DeNiro wasn't in Hurly Burly. I rarely post videos, but this Louis CK/Bradley Cooper clip is very, very funny.
https://t.co/YwJunJMyAi @RobertMarkEnger he's good. He has inverted lashes amongst MANY health issues and that's why he was abandoned. @nicholebeattie why can't every day start with you pulling up beside me at dr valet? @JesseBradford come on! You use yours daily! Do guys ever use the hole in the front of their underwear? @devilstrifecta yep. it's real 'hollywood magic'... @KrisKrislynl first thoughts "Would I get murdered for owning that? It is legal?" @E_Megas @JoelGHodgson i love that dog @cass_hobbins ha! No!! I think because I'd been to Vancouver and LA and had a cabin at Sylvan?? Was used to waves? Funny tho. @ERlBERRY yes! Why? @straqe1 She's almost 13 and now the top student at her school. She's just smart. @straqe1 Yes, never sure what to do with that. She was 7.5 when she read the Hunger Games and I knew it was too mature, but it's READING! @johnpemble I love her. @tobyherman27 I can't remember if she liked it, I'll ask.  She's going on Saturday! I can't wait to see it. @calvinlovemusic from one edmontonian to another, please play a show in LA. I asked my cat if he gets flashbacks... http://t.co/U4QG72d5ay I flew business! RT @ReachRenee Never heard of you, but feel free to leave the USA to whatever country you crawled out of @LouisPeitzman You took Bea to NY? My grandfather fought in WWII and the only time I feel life-threatening fear is when I think I've just sent a text to the wrong person. @chrissyteigen There are 6 of us on my FB page who have racked up over 1400 comments over several posts since the 12th. We are exhausted. Just realized I've had Genesis 'In Too Deep' on repeat for over twenty minutes, this is my mid-life crisis. @chrissyteigen I've been tweeting you a lot. I'm forgetting there are other people/obsessed with this plane. @chrissyteigen Canadian Theories. We rational, we good, we thoughtful. @joeindc44 thank you! I knew it couldn't just be people who followed the two of us. Our fan base is smarter ;) I KID! @johnlevenstein @shelbyfero you two goofballs! SEX = $$$. Hahahaha! Cool stuff. Have a really fun day you guys! @joeindc44 where did you see the tweet? What third party posted? How she says, "Yup, we're having an earthquake," is as funny as his face.
http://t.co/igxPEFq3IX Is it legal to murder the guy in the office next door for saying, "He spoke Mexican and we spoke American!" 4 times in the last 2 mins? That aftershock felt like an elephant fell against the garage door. If that was only a 4.4 I'm moving. No way. RT @911LAPD: Please do not call 911 to report the #earthquake. We are well aware of it. Lines need to be kept open for emergencies. Earthquake awake isn't cool!! @wheezyt @Sethrogen You can appreciate and love Santa Clause and still know he isn't real. (just made that up. not sure it works. night) @Sethrogen They also think the only way a Canadian gets cancer treatment is if they come to the US, because they "heard that." @Sethrogen There's still so, so much for me to learn. I can not believe I moved to a country where people do not believe science is real. I don't understand. God bless Cosmos. Goodnight. @GuyEndoreKaiser FINE. I will delete my tweets because I want people to care. BUT I STILL BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. (I'm dumb) (without weed) Look, I'm into Star Trek and High School level education, but I can't deal with this show. #cosmos I got a pedicure for my gynecologist. :( @markhoppus happy birthday!!!!! i hope this year is your best yet!! xxoo Is my kid an official US Citizen if she just talked about how good the ranch dressing at the Cheesecake Factory is for 10mins? @Desk_Cop @RealSharHorgan @robdelaney I've been tweeting about my love for @futureislands for 2 years.
